# SparkPost email extension for CiviCRM

This extension allows CiviCRM to send emails and process bounces through the SparkPost service.

It was designed to seamlessly integrate in the CiviCRM UI, be fully documented and well maintained, be trivial to install and configure, be nimble and fast and accurately process bounces.
It currently is one of the [Top 10](https://stats.civicrm.org/?tab=sites) most used extensions for CiviCRM.

Full documentation (including installation instructions) can be found at https://docs.civicrm.org/sparkpost.

## Maintenance status

As the number of voluntary donations to maintain & support the extension can still be counted with a single hand, maintenance of this extension is officially discontinued. You can still contract Cividesk, or any other CiviCRM provider, for any needed maintenance. Thanks for your understanding.

But ... you can still show your support as indicated below. Hopefully that will make us change our minds ...

## Show your support!

Development of this extension was fully self-funded by Cividesk and equated to about 40 hours of work.

You can show your support and appreciation for our work by making a donation at https://www.cividesk.com/pay and indicating 'SparkPost support' as the invoice id.

Suggested donation amounts are _$40 for end-users_, and _$40 per client_ using this extension for service providers. With these suggested amounts, we would need 120 donations just to recoup our development costs. Needless to say we are far from that at the moment!

These donations will fund maintenance and updates for this extension, as well as production of other extensions in the future.

Thanks!
